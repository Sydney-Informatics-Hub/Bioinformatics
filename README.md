This page includes bioinformatics pipelines, software, and training material developed by the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html), which is a Core Research Facility of the University of Sydney. The Sydney Informatics Hub is an official node of the [Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/), and has worked in partnership with [National Computational Infrastructure](https://nci.org.au/), [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au), and [QCIF](https://www.qcif.edu.au/) to create command-line resources that make bioinformatics more accessible for life scientists. 

Many of the resources available here are focused on making processing data at scale more accessible. To achieve this we have developed optimised pipelines for national HPC infrastructures and resources for workflow development.

## :computer: Reproducible pipelines 

Our pipelines have been optimised for compute platforms including the University of Sydney's HPC [Artemis](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/artemis/), the [National Compute Infrastructure](https://nci.org.au/) (NCI), Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre's HPC [Setonix](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/setonix/) and [Nimbus cloud](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/nimbus-cloud-service/), the University of Queensland's (UQ's) HPC [Flashlite](https://rcc.uq.edu.au/filething/get/14818/FlashLite_User_Guide_20200122.pdf) and AWS Cloud. You can find DOIs for all our pipelines at the Sydney Informatics Hub's [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/43#workflows). 

We also support the use of [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) workflows. Check out the [institutional configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) we've build for Australian HPC and cloud infrastructures.

## :mortar_board: Self-directed training materials

We deliver national training events focused on the accessibility of command-line bioinformatics as a part of the Australian BioCommons training cooperative. Visit their [events page](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events) for upcoming events. You can find recordings of past events on the [Australian BioCommons YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AustralianBioCommonsChannel) and the [Sydney Informatics Hub YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sydneyinformaticshub1170). Materials for all Australian BioCommons events are published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/australianbiocommons-training/).
