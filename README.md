## Gadi optimised pipelines

The Sydney Informatics Hub has worked alongside with the National Compute Infrastructure (NCI) team to establish fast, efficient and scalable bioinformatics workflows on NCI’s HPC, Gadi. The workflows implement best practice workflows and reputable software and are specifically designed to utilise NCI Gadi’s infrastructure optimally. The table below contains a list and descriptions of bioinformatics workflows optimised for NCI Gadi that are available on our GitHub page.
